# 🌱 Biofuel Manufacturing Model

This project involves the implementation of a **biofuel manufacturing model** in **Julia**, utilizing the **JuMP** optimization package. The primary goal of the model is to optimize the distribution of resources while adhering to predefined system constraints.

### Key Features:
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient allocation of raw materials to maximize biofuel production.
- **Constraints Handling**: Ensured the system operates within real-world constraints, such as supply limits and production capacities.
- **JuMP Integration**: Leveraged Julia's powerful JuMP package to implement and solve the optimization problem.

### Technologies Used:
- **Julia**: For high-performance numerical computing.
- **JuMP**: A domain-specific modeling language for mathematical optimization.
